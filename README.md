## üîç Overview

The **OpenModelica Model Launcher (OML)** is a graphical user interface (**GUI**) application designed to simplify the execution of Modelica simulations. 
This launcher allows you to:
- Select Modelica model executables.
- Configure simulation parameters such as start time and stop time.
- Execute the selected model and generate output files in `.mat` format.
- Visualize the simulation results using Matplotlib for detailed analysis.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **User-Friendly GUI**:
    - Simple design using PyQt6 for smooth user interaction.
    - Seamless integration of widgets for parameter configuration and model selection.

- **üåê Platform Support**:

    - **Linux**
    - **Windows**

- **üéõÔ∏è Simulation Control**:
    - Configure simulation start and stop times.
    - Execute Modelica models using the specified parameters.
    - Plot the model output when the "Plot the Output" button is        pressed.
    - Receive real-time status updates during execution.

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling and Notifications**:
    - Real-time feedback on simulation success or failure with detailed logs.
    - Display user-friendly error and status messages via popups.

- **üìù Logging**:
    - Detailed logging system for debugging and analysis (log files and console output).
    - Configurable logging to ensure ease of troubleshooting.

## üö¶ Getting Started

### üîß Prerequisites
The following software and dependencies must be installed on your system:
1. Python 3.12.0 or higher.
2. The following Python libraries installed using `pip`:
    - `PyQt6` (for GUI development)
    - `logging` (for logging functionality)
    - `matplotlib` (for plotting results)
    - `scipy` (for handling .mat files)
    - `qdarktheme` (for dark theme support)
3. OpenModelica simulation executable.

To install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   **or**
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìñ Usage Instructions

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 1: Launching the Application
Run the script `ModelLauncher.py` using Python or launch the application.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Setting up the Simulation
1. **Select Model File**: Click "Choose File" and browse for the Modelica model executable file.
2. **Set Start and Stop Time**:
    - Enter the start and stop times for your simulation in the respective fields.
    - Ensure that the stop time is greater than the start time.
3. **Validate Parameters**:
    - Once your parameters are set, click "Set" to validate the inputs.

### üèÉ Step 3: Running the Simulation
- To generate a plot, ensure you check the "Plot the O/p" button before launching.
- Click the "Launch" button to start the simulation.
- The simulation will execute in the background with real-time progress tracking.
- Notifications will display the results, indicating success or failure.

### ‚ùì Step 4: Additional Help
- Click the "History" button to view recent simulation logs.
- Use the "Docs" button to access detailed information about the application and relevant links.
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Workflow
1. **Model Selection**: Choose a Modelica model executable (`*.exe` for Windows).
2. **Define Parameters**:
    - Enter values for:
        - Start Time: `0`
        - Stop Time: `5`
3. **Simulation Launch**:
    - Check the "Plot the O/p" option if you need to generate plots.
    - Click "Launch" to start the execution.
    - Check logs and notification pop-ups for results.
---

## üìù Logging
The application uses a centralized logging system to provide detailed analysis and debugging:
- Console output for real-time monitoring.
- Recent simulation data can be viewed using the "History" button.
- Log files are saved as `OPLauncher.log` for deeper diagnostics.
